Up to this point, there are by far no contributors to the making and design of this website. Therefore marking my first website during my course program at Moringa School on the 12th of June 2021.

# DESCRIPTION
These are traditional naming systems that apply to children depending on factors surrounding their birth. Aside from being traditional methods of naming, AKAN names are easy conversation starters and ice breakers.
The AKAN people have preserved their culture and customs by passing them down to their descendants hence transmitting knowledge and wisdom.
